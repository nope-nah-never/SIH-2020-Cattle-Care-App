# SIH-2020-Cattle-Care-App
Project developed by Team Eastwind for the SIH 2020 Grand Finale 


This is a Mobile application which is based on Android platform to control the menace caused by the stray cattle on roads and provide better Governance by more involvement of public. Furthermore, it acts as a proper channel for flow of information amongst the users, drivers and the authorities such as municipalities, animal welfare organisations, NGOs etc.

The application has two interfaces- one for the user and the other for the driver.

The basic idea of the app is to report any stray cattle found on the road or public areas by lodging a complaint.

The user logs in the application where his location would be tracked automatically after seeking permission. He clicks the picture of the cattle and uploads it. After providing the necessary information, a complaint is lodged which is immediately received by the driver with the most proximity. After the driver reaches the location and picks up the cattle, he marks the complaint as resolved.

The users can check all their lodged complaints, donate for the welfare of the cattle, adopt a rescued animal and check the news and blogs related to cattle!
